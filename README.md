# distributed-server

Synchronize files across multiple systems to run a single server on different hosts, one host at a time.  
This project was created to handle game servers such as for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) or [Terraria](https://terraria.org/) but may be modified for more general use.

(Not extensively tested.)
